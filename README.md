# City Building through Matching
This file briefly summarizes the organization of the stata code...

The project continues to use the LIAB LM 9310 (provided by the FDZ/IAB, https://fdz.iab.de/en/Integrated_Establishment_and_Individual_Data/LIAB.aspx); 
		the newest version of this dataset, described on the website is the LIAB LM 9317
		the dataset is provided by the German Social Security administration, see the website for how to apply for data access.
		---note that the IAB has a "fake" dataset available for download on which this code can be tested.
